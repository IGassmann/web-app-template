## Writing an ADR

To list all ADRs, run:

```sh
pnpm adr:list
```

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```sh
pnpm adr:new
```

To preview the architectural decision log locally, run:

```sh
pnpm adr:preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.
